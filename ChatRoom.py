# Description: Vasya has recently learned to type and log on to the Internet. 
# He immediately entered a chat room and decided to say hello to everybody. 
# Vasya typed the word s. It is considered that Vasya managed to say hello 
# if several letters can be deleted from the typed word so that it resulted in the word "hello". 
# For example, if Vasya types the word "ahhellllloou", it will be considered that he said hello, and 
# if he types "hlelo", it will be considered that Vasya got misunderstood and he didn't manage to say hello. 
# Determine whether Vasya managed to say hello by the given word s.
